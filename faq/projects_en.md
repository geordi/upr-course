## Project

The project assignment is available in the [Kelvin](https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz) system.

You can choose between the "classic" project and an [SDL](https://mrlvsb.github.io/upr-skripta/c/aplikovane_ulohy/sdl.html) project.  
The SDL project is more demanding and is recommended for students who wish to go beyond the standard curriculum and learn something new during its implementation.  
Your choice of project must be reported to your teaching assistant by **October 31, 2025**.

The project is worth a maximum of **30 points** (for either option).

You will be required to defend your project before your teaching assistant at an agreed-upon date, which you will be informed about in advance.

### Submission Deadline

The project must be submitted by **January 2, 2026, 23:59**.  
This deadline **will not be extended**. Projects not submitted by this deadline will receive a score of 0.  
The official submission time is determined by the date and timestamp recorded in the [Kelvin](https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz) system.
