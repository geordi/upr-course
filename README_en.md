# Introduction to Programming

In this repository, you will find all information regarding the course *Introduction to Programming* (UPR), which is taught at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.vsb.cz), [VŠB - Technical University of Ostrava](https://www.vsb.cz).

**The online textbook (primary study material) can be found [here](https://mrlvsb.github.io/upr-skripta/uvod/uvod.html).**

## Assessment

To pass the course with a grade, you must earn at least 51 points (out of 100). Points can be obtained from the following components (all minimum requirements must be met):

### Full-time Study

- 10 points (min 0) – midterm test
- 45 points (min 18) – homework assignments
- 30 points (min 15) – course project
- 15 points (min 6) – final exam

### Part-time Study

- 55 points (min 28) – homework assignments
- 30 points (min 15) – course project
- 15 points (min 8) – final exam


## Projects

Project information can be found [here](faq/projects_en.md).


## Exercises

See the page dedicated to [exercises](exercises_en.md).

To strengthen your programming skills, you can try solving the [practice tasks](tasks).


## Lectures

A list of [lectures](lectures_en.md) is available on a separate page.  
Some lectures are also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCplsQTrQdWEej9tvBxifUFQ).


## Homework

Homework is submitted through the [Kelvin](https://kelvin.cs.vsb.cz) system.

Homework must be completed individually. Work on your own.  
Plagiarism will first be penalized with a deduction of 10 points from homework.  
Repeated plagiarism will result in failing the course.  
It will not be investigated who copied from whom. Don’t copy, and you won’t have a problem.

Some students, when "caught," claim they don’t know what plagiarism is and thought their behavior did not count as plagiarism. To avoid confusion, here are some examples:

- What is acceptable:
   - Asking the instructor (e.g., on Discord) for advice or guidance on a specific problem.
   - Asking a classmate (e.g., on Discord) for an explanation of a concept.
- What is not acceptable:
   - Looking at someone else’s code. Once you see another solution, you will never write it differently!
     You may also gain a false sense that you understand the code. But reading code and nodding in agreement
     is completely different from writing the solution independently from scratch — which is far more challenging.
   - Dictating to someone else (or being dictated to) exactly how to write code. Dictating is equivalent to showing a solution.
   - Sharing your code with others, uploading it to a public repository, or using code obtained in this way.


## Study Materials

A [concise online textbook](https://mrlvsb.github.io/upr-skripta/) with interactive code examples has been prepared to explain the topics covered in this course.  
[The source code of this text](https://github.com/mrlvsb/upr-skripta) is also available, and you are welcome to contribute or comment.

In the [books](books.md) section, you will find recommended reading.

## Other Useful Resources

For visualizing simple programs, you can use [Python Tutor for C](http://pythontutor.com/c.html).  
It allows you to step through your program and see how memory changes.

[The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is an excellent resource on tools and techniques that every computer science student should know, but which are often missing from standard curricula.  
If you want to become proficient in everyday developer tools, this resource is highly recommended.
